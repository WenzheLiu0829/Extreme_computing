is no way to mark or otherwise prevent an image from being zoomed when the user requests could use and detect the zoom amount using one of the techniques described at Page Zoom in Firefox 3 Once you know the zoom you could apply that percentage adjustment to the images you want to leave at a fixed whole thing is a house of cards The solution does not detect zoom amount when the page is first so need a Flash component on the page just to detect the zoom the actual effect of the zooming will be jarring for the The image resizing will lag slightly behind the zoom causing the page to possibly moving the content they were trying to zoom in on in the first

is the class for XML provided by the Qpy package in both superfast C and alternative python Evoque looks for this specific class when equivalent is used on template loading or any custom type may be specified as value to the quoting The package provides a base and some concrete to make the definition of your custom types as the is not yet available it is mentioned in the changelog but for an as yet unreleased version of Evoque the changelog you pass the output of a whole bunch of templates thru you might also wish to consider specifying it as a either on each or as default filter on a An example of using filters filters would in fact be a better approach as it is more general you not have to the call within be able to use the exact same function as filter in even when these specify a quoting other than

going to be writing a program which has some web services in it that use XML to pass data back and The format of the XML is predefined I change it to suit my needs but in code I can handle the data any way I Is it better for me to handle the data structure in code as an XML or to write an equivalent data structure as an object in the language along with some utility functions for conversion to and from the have some thoughts on the issue but I want to unintentionally bias This is a but if any language considerations you have like to hear To the XML format itself is setup in a logical The object in the language differ much from For it might look something like this is a poor but you get the gist I it better to use an XML data structure or a custom data structure that can be converted to

find a good title for the this is what trying to is need to store up to 200000 objects need to store about 10 of them per second from use binaryserialization before storing need to access them later on by an unique the best way to do keep them on memory as get outofmemory I store them in the disk as separate files what are the possible performance Would it decrease the overall performance I implement some sort of for example combine 100 objects and write it once as one Then parse them later Or something use a time is not there be search and access only couple of times by the known unique In theory I need a I want to complicate assume database would be slower than file prove me wrong if you got something about So why also leaning towards to file But what truly worried is about writing per second to HDD can be any I control a desktop tool which will be deployed in different I use file system store files in separate folders to avoid related issues you can ignore that way to store many files in
question says using Managed and the tags say using in VS 2005 or probably have a less confusing time with what then there are two ways to from Suppose you have some c new Call some will call ToString on Finished with can write this in like gcnew Call some will call ToString on Finished with variable is called a not a declared with instead of Also we have to use instead of This is the same thing as a reference variable in and is analogous not to a pointer in so we use to access you can write it like Create with local Call some will call ToString on MyClass the thing to we declare it in the style of a local There is no need to explicitly the we treat the object as if it was a local variable a reference to such a So we use instead of we can this local object into a by prefixing it with which acts like the equivalent of that we use with ordinary It means the address or me a handle an we have to call on the The compiler does that for us at the end of the scope in which we declared as the method is the mechanism by which destructors are implemented in

are 3 primary forms of Design Hopefully you write a spec before writing the so there is a clear description of what the code is meant to and how it is intended to work and be find that for anything other than the most trivial any time spent doing this usually reduces the overall time spent on a task and the number of bugs that So while I enjoy it as much as worth API If anyone is ever going to call a then it saves a lot of time and improves code quality if the method is Many simple methods can be using good but often little pieces of information can save a lot of time are is it or is it to pass in a find that any code that I use on a daily basis is usually mostly forgotten within a couple of so API documentation significantly improves productivity overall by allowing me to quickly confirm the parameter requirements and operation of a rather than having to go and work it all out form first With tools like intellisense you often need to look at the source code for the API you are Comments on subtle but important features that only take a few seconds to write will save days of debugging far more often than you might Code This is where you comment small blocks of code within a method to describe what the block There are a couple of important a summary the preferences to an xml might summarise a block of This allows programmers to the of a method and zone in on the important bit instead of having to read the whole method carefully to work it all a comment describing why you did something a specific way must not be deleted yet because object X is still using or the result using bitwise operations as this is a section of This is essential to stop a programmer from refactoring this code without realising that there might be unintended side effects to their this is vital to allow programmers to understand the flow of an implementation and to avoid people misunderstanding why code is written as it my answer spend any time You should spend all your time writing maintainable Documentation is part and parcel of IMHO not a separate and not I like to time writing so I automated as much of the process as I could and bundled it into a Pro for Visual Similar addins are available for most IDEs so check them out and save a lot of

you have a table with a Geometry type field you can call the function to have the shapes reduced in number of Works very when sevral of the polygons are adjacent share parts of their the reduced polygons do not necessarily do SQL TABLE into VALUES into VALUES into VALUES into VALUES as reducedShape from table returns two sets of First the unreduced the reduced shapes are much simpler and they do have the rough shape but what I would want is to have the still So they have to be reduced in a think you have to break them up into polylines first edge to then Reduce the lines and then reassembling them to polygons I have no idea how to do this in accepted Both current answers entirely covincing to but alphadogg has certainly put in the most effort and I really appreciate any sharing of So the bounty goes to will with a later if I find a satisfying I with Isaac Program Manager on the SqlServer Geo His helpfull response is problem is not at all it something we an operation requires knowledge of the topology your and we anything like this built you want to separate polygons for you want store curves representing portions and reuse these for multiple When you generalize the and all dependent are could build this posters in the thread you it may be real effort to know the but this is the If you want you could use package like the FME from Software FME do but I believe it has functionality to do what looking hope this would I generalize multiple adjacent
